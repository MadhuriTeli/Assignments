Assignment 1: Assign a set of characters to a String involving Brackets "{([])}" characters.
Ex: 
I/p : str = "{()[[]}"
O/p: The Brackets do not match

I/p : str = "{()[[]]}"
O/p: The Brackets match

Assignment 2: Implement Stack & Queue using a Linked List.

Assignment 3: Implement a Circular Queue using Linked List. 

Assignment 4:
Create a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted in ascending order.

Eg.
i/p
 20, 5, 10, 30, 25

o/p
 5,10, 20, 25, 30

Assignment 5:					     th 
Consider a singly linked list. Rotate the list from k   position from the last node.
Eg.
  k = 2
10, 20, 30, 40, 50

After rotation
o/p
40, 50, 10, 20, 30

Write a recursive method to return nth term of Fibonacci Series.
1st term = 0
2nd term = 1
3rd = 1
4th = 2
