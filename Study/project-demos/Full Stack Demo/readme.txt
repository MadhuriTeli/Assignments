Dear All , 
 In attached zip , use spring-boot-security-jwt , as a back end n it's react front end is demo5.
It uses method based authorization (refer to web security config class : WebSecurityConfig  & TestController) 
. I have also attached another spring project : spring-angular-jwt-backend : this uses URL based authorization (refer to SecurityConfig.java)
It does not have react front end!
