Enums
What is it ? : enum : keyword --set of related constants
Which is the super class of all java enums ? : java.lang.Enum

eg : public enum CustomerCategory
{
 SILVER,GOLD,DIAMOND,PLATINUM
}

eg class : public class CustomerCategory extends Enum

what are legal access sepcifiers for enum ? : default/public 

What will javac generate (for above constatnts)
data member : self typed constants
eg : public static final CustomerCategory SILVER; //null

Which constructor added by javac ? : private CustomerCategory (String name,int ordinal)
{
   super(name,ordinal);
}

Static init block ? : 
static {
  SILVER=new CustomerCategory("SILVER",0);
....
  PLATINUM=new CustomerCategory("PLATINUM",3);
}

Which methods ?
public static CustomerCategory[] values();
public static CustomerCategory valueOf(String name) throws IllegalArgumentException
eg : Tester :
 validateCategory(sc.next());

Utils :
public static CustomerCategory validateCategory(String catgeory)
{
   return CustomerCategory.valueOf(category.toUpperCase());
}


Which method can be overridden ? : toString
Which methods can not be overridden ? equals,hashCode,compareTo

How will you establish : Customer HAS-A CustomerCategory ?
By adding the ref of CustomerCategory  as a data member of Customer
eg :
public class Customer
{
 ..... +
  private CustomerCategory category;


}

Nested classes : class declaed within another class
Main 2 categories : non static nested class (inner class)
method local inner class
ano inner class

non static nested class (inner class) :
1. Can inner class contain static & non static members ?  NO (can contain only non static memebrs)
no static methods, static final data members, no static init blocks
2. Can inner class methods access outer's private members ? YES (directly=> w/o creating instance of the outer class)
3. Can Outer class access inner's private members directly ? NO
How to access ? : by creating inner class instance
BUT in the static method of outer class : create Outer's instance n within that create inner's instance.

static nested class

Today's topics 

static nested classes : This not really a nested class, rather it's considered as the static member of the outer class.

A static class  created inside a class is called static nested class in java. 

It can contain static n non static memebrs.
It cannot access non-static data members and methods of the outer class directly. 
BUT can access static members of the outer class directly.
It can be accessed by just outer class name.


Method local Inner class
A class  created inside a method is called method local inner class in java. 
If you want to invoke the methods of local inner class, you must instantiate this class inside the method.

Anonymous inner class
An inner class with no name is known as anonymous inner class in java. 

It can be used if you want to override method/s of class or interface. 

Java Anonymous inner class can be created by two ways:

Class (may be abstract or concrete).
Interface



Generics
